# Gas Pipeline Construction Optimization

This repository hosts an algorithmic solution for optimizing the construction of gas pipelines for efficiency and fairness. The project aims to address the following objectives:

1. **Efficient Line Construction:** Construct a gas pipeline in a straight line that serves all houses efficiently. Efficiency here is defined as minimizing a specific cost function.
   
2. **Fair Line Construction:** Construct a gas pipeline in a way that minimizes the maximum distance to any house, ensuring fairness among served houses.

3. **Multiple Efficient Lines:** Optimize the construction of multiple gas pipelines to serve a set of houses efficiently, introducing a novelty using silhouette score.

## Problem Statement

Consider a set of houses represented by coordinates (latitude, longitude). The objective is to design algorithms that find optimal or near-optimal solutions for constructing gas pipelines based on the following criteria:

### Distance Definition

The distance from a point `p` to a line `l` is defined as:

```
dist(p,l) := || (I - aa^t)(p-b)||^2
```

Where:
- `l = {a, b}` represents a straight line with a direction vector `a` of unit norm and a point `b` on the line.
- `|| . ||` denotes the Euclidean norm.
- `I` is the identity matrix.

### Objectives

1. **Efficient Line Construction Objective:**
   - Minimize the cost function:
     ```
     ∑(i in [n]) || (I - aa^T).p ||^2
     ```

2. **Fair Line Construction Objective:**
   - Minimize the maximum distance to any house:
     ```
     min(l) max(i in [n]) || dist(p_i, l) ||
     ```

3. **Multiple Efficient Lines Objective:**
   - Minimize the sum of distances from each house to its nearest line:
     ```
     ∑(i in [n]) min(e in L) || dist(p_i, e) ||
     ```

## Algorithm Design

## Novelty

In this project, we introduce a novel approach to optimizing gas pipeline construction by considering various factors such as efficiency, fairness, and multiple lines simultaneously. Our algorithms incorporate innovative techniques to address these objectives, offering solutions that aim to improve upon existing methodologies.

### Silhouette Score

One of the key novelties in our approach is the utilization of silhouette score in the context of multiple efficient lines construction. Silhouette score is typically used in clustering analysis to evaluate the quality of clusters. Here, we adapt this metric to assess the efficiency of line placement relative to the distribution of houses, providing a novel perspective on optimization.

By leveraging silhouette score, we aim to achieve a balance between minimizing the sum of distances from houses to their nearest lines while considering the inherent structure of the house distribution. This novel application enhances the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithms in real-world scenarios.
